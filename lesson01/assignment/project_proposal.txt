Course project proposal

I want to build a site that includes present climate information and future conditions to the users.

Not sure how in depth I’ll get into yet, still getting ideas for the site. In short, I want this site to be informational and eductional with a pratical purpose too. As far as I’m concerned that weather/environment/activities go hand in hand.

As one who like to garden and work out, I check out the weather forcast to plan for ideal activities for the coming days or to get mentally ready if nothing else.

For example, what’s the fire season or forecast is in California? Is it going to affect the air quality in Seattle that I might not want to jog outdoor for a while.

There is a wealth of free APIs to tap into @ https://apilist.fun/collection/help-fix-the-climate.

Examples of API:
•	Visual crossing weather api - The API provides instant access to both historical weather reports and forecast data in a convenient, comma separated, tabular format

•	Noaa climate data API - Weather and climate data, Climate Data Online (CDO) provides free access to NCDC's archive of global historical weather and climate data in addition to station history information

•	Open charge API - The global public registry of electric vehicle charging locations
